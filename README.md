## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

I started with building out html structure as a whole and in the process split them into their own componenets. Everything was really easy and I completed
them real fast. The most time consuming part of this project was fixing typescript errors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles



### Continued development

My plans are to build a lot personal mini projects to build up better portfolio. I want to focus on typescript and getting comfortable with it cause it is
a really helpful tool for developer experience.
